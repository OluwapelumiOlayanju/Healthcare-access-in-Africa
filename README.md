# Healthcare Access in Africa

## Overview

At Healthvise, we believe quality healthcare should be accessible to all—not just a privilege for a few. This project explores healthcare disparities in Africa, especially between rural and urban communities, using Power BI to provide data-driven insights for policy and decision-making.


## Problem Statement

### Rural Africa suffers from:

Limited healthcare facilities

Understaffed clinics

Poor emergency response

### Urban areas, while better equipped, still face:

Overcrowded facilities

Uneven funding allocation

The lack of data-informed strategies continues to widen the accessibility gap.



## Objectives

Analyze rural vs. urban healthcare facility distribution.

Evaluate healthcare funding efficiency and impact.

Examine workforce and emergency response disparities.

Recommend better resource allocation.

Visualize findings using Power BI dashboards.

## Tools Used

Excel – Data cleaning.

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

Word/MS Office – Documentation

## Key Business Questions
How are facilities distributed across regions?

Who receives more funding: urban or rural areas?

Does more funding improve emergency response?

Which facility type is most efficient per patient visit?

##KPIs
Countries analyzed: 10

Facility types: 3 (Clinics, Hospitals, Health Centers)

Avg. distance to facility: 10.57 km

Total healthcare funding: $213M USD

Avg. satisfaction rate: 77.48%



## Insights Drawn
1. Facility Distribution
Rural areas have 7x more facilities but still face access challenges.

2. Funding Comparison
Urban avg. funding: $109K

Rural avg. funding: $106K

Slight difference, but rural areas serve more patients.

3. Funding vs. Emergency Response
No strong link found.

Suggests response time is more affected by infrastructure and personnel.

4. Funding Efficiency
All facility types have similar costs per patient (~$10).

No standout in cost-efficiency.

5. Resource Distribution
Clinics hold the highest share of doctors, nurses, and beds.

6. Workforce by Country
More nurses than doctors across all countries.

Zambia leads in total healthcare personnel.

## Recommendations
#### To Bridge the Urban-Rural Healthcare Gap:

Fund rural infrastructure (electricity, internet, roads).

Incentivize rural healthcare workers.

Deploy mobile clinics and enhance telemedicine.

Improve emergency response systems.

#### To Optimize Funding Allocation:

Base budgets on demand and facility efficiency.

Encourage public-private partnerships.

Involve communities in healthcare decisions.
